# Dependecies:
- Windows SDK in 'windows'.
- Terminal that supports escape codes in 'linux'.

# Purpose:
- Provide cross platform easy ascii rendering for the Terminal.


## renderer:

-> HINT: The variables in the rendering apis are not meant to be used by the user,
		 only in the api.
		 Modifying them might cause unexpected behaviour.
		 Only the function are meant to be called by the user.



--> on windows:

- swap_buffers():
This function updates variables like console size
and swaps the two buffers.
It also sleeps the app for the draw draw interval amount,
which by default is 60.
Mind you, This func must be called at the end of the main loop,
otherwise the app won't work as expected.

- clear_console():
Clears the console by filling it with blanks.

- init_renderer():
This function initializes all the variables and buffers.
It must be called before you can use any other functions,
otherwise the app will not work.

- draw_char(char character[], Vec2 pos):
Takes a c string and a Vec2 as input,
and it draws the string at the specified position,
that is, only if the string passed is of size one,
if it's any larger the func won't work as expected.

- draw_chars(char character[], int size, Vec2 pos):
Same as draw_char() but it draws as many chars as you want,
that is, as long as you pass in the correct string size.

- set_draw_interval(float draw_interval):
Sets the draw interval, which by default, is 60.
If it's increased then the app runs slower,
if decreased then it runs faster.

- terminate_renderer():
On windows at least, this function does nothing,
its only purpose is to keep code compatible with both linux and windows.



--> on linux:

- set_cursor_pos(Vec2 pos):
This function sets the cursor position to the input position.
Mind you, this function is only meant to be used by the linux API,
Using it in your code will cause your code to be incompatible with windows.

- swap_buffers():
This function updates variables like console size.
It also sleeps the app for the draw draw interval amount,
which by default is 60.
Mind you, This func must be called at the end of the main loop,
otherwise the app won't work as expected.

- clear_console():
Clears the console.

- init_renderer():
This function initializes all the variables and enters alternative buffer mode.
It must be called before you can use any other functions,
otherwise the app will not work as expected.

- draw_char(char character[], Vec2 pos):
Takes a c string and a Vec2 as input,
and it draws the string at the specified position,
that is, only if the string passed is of size one,
if it's any larger the func won't work as expected.

- draw_chars(char character[], int size, Vec2 pos):
Same as draw_char() but it draws as many chars as you want,
that is, as long as you pass in the correct string size.

- set_draw_interval(float draw_interval):
Sets the draw interval, which by default, is 60.
If it's increased then the app runs slower,
if decreased then it runs faster.

- terminate_renderer():
This function exits alternative buffer mode,
and sets the cursor back to visible.
