# Purpose:
- Provide functions to easily handle mathematical expressions.


## MATH:

The math API contains 4 functions, which are:

- square():
This function squares the input number and returns it as a double.

- cube():
This function cubes the input number and returns it as a double.

- parse():
This function takes a c string expression and an int address as input.
It returns an array of string tokens.
And it writes the size of the array to the input int address.

- evaluate():
This function takes an array of string tokens and the size of such array as input.
It returns the evaluated expression as a double.

# Example Usage:
```c
int size;
char** tokens = parse("5*5", &size);
double result = evaluate(tokens, size);
```
